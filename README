What is it?
-----------

This base package contains Perl extension interfaces for generating slides (XML format)
from Topic Maps

   http://www.topicmaps.org/

The idea is to have the knowledge in the Topic Maps and to generate a slide show from
there whenever necessary. This avoids that much knowledge is duplicated into slide
documents.

Installation
------------

To build the extensions, unpack this distribution somewhere, and
exercise the usual incantation:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

There are a lot of other packages we rely on, so be prepared to
install a few; or use the cpan frontend doing that for you.

Dependencies
------------

This package is depending on a myriad of other Perl packages. CPAN
is your friend.

IFF you want to make use of the backend converters (HTML, LateX, PDF),
you will need the following packages

  - libxslt http://xmlsoft.org/#XSLT

    install libxml2 and libxslt together with xsltproc.

  - LaTeX in full beauty (http://www.ctan.org/)

  - Prosper (http://prosper.sourceforge.net/)

This is NOT necessary for installation.

Documentation
-------------

Plz look into the docs directory.
