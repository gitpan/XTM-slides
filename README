XTM::slides
-----------

This base package contains Perl extension interfaces for 
generating slides from Topic Maps

   http://www.topicmaps.org/

To build the extensions, unpack this distribution somewhere, and
exercise the usual incantation:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

There are a lot of other packages we rely on, so be prepared to
install a few; or use the cpan frontend doing that for you.

Setup
-----

Currently the setup is simple:

  - A Perl binary (stm2sml.pl) will be installed in the INSTALLBIN directory. 
    Plz consult its documentation. It will read an .stm file, will read all 
    Topic Maps mentioned therein and will generate an XML representation
    of this slide show (yes, yet another XML language, it is described via
    a DTD in the docs directory).

  - After you have created this SlideML XML document you should look into the 
    utils directory how to postprocess this for various backends. Currently the
    package supports

        - LaTeX with Prosper to produce PDF slides

        - HTML

    You will need XSLT support from

      http://xmlsoft.org/#XSLT

    and install libxml2 and libxslt together with xsltproc.

    Have a look at the Makefile there to get the idea. If you have LaTeX installed,
    a

      make http.pdf

    should work.


Let me know whether I forgot a dependency on some other package.

As many people are working on slide support for Perl, the above might change 
readically.
