This directory contains some infrastructure to convert SMiLe XML documents
into other formats:

  - html (single HTML page)
  - prosper (LaTeX slide style)

More formats should be added here.

The Makefile in this directory should give you an idea how things are
related. What I am doing here is to copy the Makefile into my own
slides directory together with the backends directory and run

  make myslide.html MAPS=file:~/where/are/maps/ BASE=~/backends/ HTMLSTYLE="'styles/plain.css'"

or

  make myslide.pdf  MAPS=file:~/where/are/maps/ BASE=~/backends/ HTMLSTYLE="'styles/plain.css'"
